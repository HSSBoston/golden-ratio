# Golden ratio, golden rectangles and golden circles


This is a [Squeak Smalltalk](https://squeak.org/) implementation of simple algorithms to draw golden rectangles and golden circles. They follow the [golden ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio), which is known as 1 : 1.62 or 5 : 8.

The golden ratio has been used in architecture, art, grahical design (including logo design and web page design), product design (such as dimensional ratio for TVs, computer screens and credit cards) and many other areas.
